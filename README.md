# ORM_E-Commerce
## Description

I am testing new found skills and built an OBJ. relational Mapping application.
I did all my testing in Insomnia. With some HTM added to this app it would be a great start for keeping inventory of any company. I learned a very in depth amount of sequelize and express.
